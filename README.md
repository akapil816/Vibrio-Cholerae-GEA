# Differential RNA-seq of Vibrio cholerae identifies the small RNA as a regulator of biofilm formation

Quorum sensing has shown to be an essential form of cell communication exhibited in Vibrio Cholerae contributing to the formation of biofilm allowing for its survival and capacity for pathogenesis in Vibrio Cholerae. Understanding the modifications and contributions of specific tRNAs can provide valuable insight into the mechanisms involved in biofilm formation.

In this study, we use tRAX (tRNA Analysis of eXpression) to examine differential gene expression between three different phases of Vibrio Cholerae: Biofilm, Exponential, Stationary phase. Our results provide slight validation of our hypothesis that tRNA gene expression in Biofilm and Stationary phases will be more similar because they both have similar levels of controlled growth.

Our findings modestly support the hypothesis that tRNA gene expression in Biofilm and Stationary phases shares similarities due to comparable growth dynamics. Notably, we observe more pronounced differential expression between the Exponential and Biofilm phases, with Leucine being significantly overexpressed and Methionine underexpressed in 3â€™ and whole tRNA fragments. These results, along with further analysis of tRNA roles in quorum sensing, provide valuable insights, potentially guiding strategies to prevent biofilm formation and mitigate Vibrio cholerae's pathogenic potential.
